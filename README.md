Benzi Edelson
Drawing on the Web Final Project - Outline
Due: April 23, 2019


	For my final project, I want to focus on Berlin. During my Junior fall semester, i studied abroad in Berlin and I thought it would be cool to highlight some of my favorite aspects of the city. In a sense, I am trying to create a virtual trip to Berlin in the eyes of Benzi. I am a huge train person, avid dancer, and architecture fan. Berlin had all of this and I want to create three drawing that bring these items to life. To me, it is the nostalgia factor. What do I miss most and can I best recreate the experience I had there in these drawings. From the colors to the music, I think of Berlin in a certain light. It brings back so many memories and I want to try my best to use these drawings as a new way to think about my time there. My first drawing will be about the trains in Berlin. The UBahn and SBahn were trains I took every day and I am going to take their icons and animate them up and down a train track and I will also use the Berlin Hauptbahnhof as a background image. Every time you click the screen, a new logo of the SBahn will spawn and follow the animation path. The second drawing will be based on the techno and party scene in Berlin. This will be more experimental with a dark, trippy background with thumping techno music. I want to recreate a club night with strobe lights and there will also be 3D objects floating around to give the club some dimension. The last drawing will be on the TV tower. I will have it centered and then the sphere of it will be replaced by a 3D sphere I code and it will be constantly rotating and when you click it will begin to move around the page so it will look like there is a giant hole in the building.
